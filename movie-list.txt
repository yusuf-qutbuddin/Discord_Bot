Pawn Sacrifice (2014)	https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596345	b'It\'s a movie based on a true story of the American chess player Bobby Fischer, who was obsessed with chess since childhood. His obsession helps him take over his goal of defeating all the best players in the world, and his specific goal of \'defeating the Russians in chess\'. The movie shows how obsession may be the quickest tool to get you to your goal, but till the time you do achieve your goal, the aspects of life which you utterly ignored build up over time, and they start reflecting in your behaviour, and after you have achieved your goal, your desire is satisfied, and you are content in that way, but the negative things which built up inside you, stay. So after your goal is achieved, you are helplessly exposed to the grave problems which had built up in your life. Only when you lose your focus on one thing, do you start to look around. The exposure to these problems, is sometimes the price you pay, to life your life as the greatest. As one of the characters said, "Bobby was more afraid of winning the game". These are the things which came to my mind. Definitely worth watching if you want to observe these things, from a real life example.'
